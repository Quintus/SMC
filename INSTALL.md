Installation instructions for SMC
=================================

SMC uses CMake[1] as the build system, so the first thing you have to
ensure is that you have CMake installed.

SMC currently supports the Linux and Windows platforms officially. To
be more exact, it is tested against Arch Linux and Windows 7. The
current Ubuntu LTS should also work. **Windows XP is unsupported**.

SMC can be installed either from Git, meaning that you clone the
repository, or from a release tarball, where for the purpose of this
document a beta release is considered a release. Finally, you have the
possibility to cross-compile to Windows from Linux either from Git or
from a release tarball. Each of these possibilities will be covered
after we have had a look on the dependencies. Note that if you want
to crosscompile, you should probably read this entire file and not
just the section on crosscompilation to get a better understanding.

Dependencies
------------

In any case, you will have to install a number of dependencies before
you can try installing SMC itself. The following sections list the
dependencies for each supported system.

### Common dependencies ###

The following dependencies are required regardless of the system you
install to.

* A Ruby 1.9 or 2.0 installation with `rake` in your PATH.
* The `gperf` program.
* The `pkg-config` program.
* The `bison` program.
* OpenGL.
* GLEW OpenGL wrangler extension library.
* GNU Gettext.
* The LibPNG library.
* The SDL main library plus SDL_image and SDL_mixer,
  all <2.0, which is not supported yet.
* The SDL_ttf library.
* The libPCRE regular expression library.
* The libxml++ library.
* The Freetype library.
* For generating the docs:
  * `kramdown` RubyGem.
  * The `dot` program.
  * The `doxygen` program.
  * Ruby’s `rdoc` program.

### Linux dependencies ###

* The DevIL library.

Additionally, SMC needs CEGUI version 0.7.x. However, as this old
version is not provided by any modern Linux distribution anymore, the
build system has been set up to download and compile it on its own and
then link it in statically. **For Windows** (see below) this does not
hold true, you have to provide CEGUI 0.7.x libraries yourself (or just
use MXE as described below). We are working on the issue and hope to
get it resolved with the next feature release of SMC.

The following commandline installs all dependencies required to built
SMC on Ubuntu Linux 14.04:

# apt-get install ruby-full rake gperf pkg-config bison libglew-dev \
  freeglut3-dev gettext libpng12-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev \
  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libpcre3-dev libxml++2.6-dev \
  libfreetype6-dev libdevil-dev libboost1.55-all-dev

Linux building is also monitored by travis-ci, a continuous integration
service: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Secretchronicles/SMC.svg)][2]

### Windows dependencies ###

* The FreeImage library.
* CEGUI version 0.7.x. CEGUI 0.8.x is not yet supported.
* For generating a setup installer:
  * The NSIS tools.

Installing from a released tarball
----------------------------------

Extract the tarball, create a directory for the build and switch into
it:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ tar -xvJf SMC-*.tar.xz
$ cd SMC-*/smc
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute `cmake` to configure and `make` to build and install SMC. Be
sure to replace `/opt/smc` with the directory you want SMC to install
into.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/smc ..
$ make
# make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want or are asked to, add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` as a
parameter to `cmake` in order to build a version with debugging
symbols. These are needed by the developers to track down bugs more
easily.

After the last command finishes, you will find a `bin/smc` executable
file below your chosen install directory. Execute it in order to start
SMC.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ /opt/smc/bin/smc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing from Git
-------------------

Installing from Git basically works the same way as the normal release
install, but with a few preparations needed. You have to clone the
repository, and initialize the Git submodules before you can continue
with the real build process. These preprations can be done as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git clone git://github.com/Secretchronicles/SMC.git
$ cd SMC
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From there on, you can continue with the normal instructions as per
the above section.

Crosscompiling from Linux to Windows
------------------------------------

SMC can be crosscompiled from Linux to Windows, such that you don’t
have to even touch a Windows system in order to generate the
executable that will run on Windows, and indeed this is how we produce
the Windows releases. Regardless whether you compile
from Git or from a release tarball, you will need a crosscompilation
toolchain for that. We recommend you to use [MXE][3] for that, which
includes all dependencies necessary for building SMC. Even more, I
(Quintus) have set up an MXE fork that contains versions that I know
to work with SMC.

The following commands download and built the MXE environment I have
prepared, including all dependencies needed for SMC.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% mkdir ~/smc-building
% cd ~/smc-building
% git clone git://github.com/Quintus/mxe.git
% cd mxe
% git checkout smc-building
% make boost libxml++ glew cegui libpng freeimage sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf nsis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will take a long time.

Now we have to work around bugs in CMake and CPack that don’t find
`i686-pc-mingw32-pkg-config` and `i686-pc-mingw32-makensis`, but will
only look for `pkg-config` and `makensis`. Do this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% cd usr/bin
% ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-makensis makensis
% ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-pkg-config pkg-config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And then edit `i686-pc-mingw32-pkg-config` with your favourite
editor. Replace the part that says

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
... exec pkg-config --static "$@"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

with this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
... exec /usr/bin/pkg-config --static "$@"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Crosscompiling from a released tarball ###

Crosscompiling from Linux to Windows works similar as native
compilation, except you have to tell CMake where your crosscompilation
toolchain resides. First, extract the tarball and prepare a build
directory as usual:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ tar -xvJf SMC-*.tar.xz
$ cd SMC-*/smc
$ mkdir crossbuild
$ cd crossbuild
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, edit the toolchain file `smc/cmake/toolchain/linux2mingw32.cmake`
to point to your MXE installation, which should be
`~/smc-building/mxe` if you followed the above steps. For this, ensure
the `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` line is correct:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH "$ENV{HOME}/smc-building/mxe")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then build SMC. Be sure to include the new parameter
`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` as shown below to make CMake aware you want a
crosscompilation with the toolchain file you just edited. Again, you
may or may not include `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` depending on whether
you want debugging symbols or not.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ export PATH=$HOME/smc-building/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/linux2mingw32.cmake \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/testinstall ..
$ make
$ make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will give you a Windows SMC installation in the
crossbuild/testinstall directory. Copy it to Windows or run it with
Wine:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% wine testinstall/bin/smc.exe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Generating a windows setup installer ####

The above method will yield a directory `testinstall/` that is
standalone e.g. for distribution in form of a ZIP file. Creating a
setup installer that registers SMC with the registry requires a
slightly different approach. If you built SMC already with the above
method, clear your `crossbuild` directory to prevent artifacts.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ rm -rf *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the above guide up until and including adding the MXE tools to
your PATH variable (the `export PATH=...` line). Then, execute the
build commands like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/linux2mingw32.cmake ..
$ make
$ cpack -G NSIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will create a `SMC-x.y.z-win32.exe` file. This file is the
ready-to-distribute setup installer.

Note that you shouldn’t install multiple versions of SMC at once using
the setup installer. Uninstall any previous version of SMC before
installing with another setup installer; the standalone approach does
not suffer from this problem.

### Crosscompiling from Git ###

Clone the Git repository and execute the preparation steps. They are
the same as for a normal non-cross build.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git clone git://github.com/Secretchronicles/SMC.git
$ cd SMC
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then continue with “Crosscompiling from a released tarball” above.
