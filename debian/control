Description: Jump and Run game like Super Mario World
 The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M. (TSC) is an Open Source two-dimensional
 platform game with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games.
 .
 The game features a rich set of levels plus an advanced level editor that
 allows you to create your own levels. It is accompanied by a powerful
 scripting engine that utilises mruby, a minimal implementation of the Ruby
 programming language.
 .
 TSC is a fork of the SMC project, whose development has stalled. Note however
 that our goals are different from those of the original SMC project, most
 notably we are working towards our own type of game rather than being solely
 inspired by one specific existing game.
