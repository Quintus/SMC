Graphics, music, and any other artistic content in the game is not licensed
under the GPL. These assets undergo different terms as outlined as follows: any
asset is accompanied by a .txt or a .settings file that specifies both the
author(s) and the license of the asset in question. Those assets whose
accompanying .txt or .settings file does not specify a license are licensed
under the old SMC Contribution license, which is included as the file
tsc/docs/pages/old_smc_contribution_license.md. Assets that are licensed as
"special" have been granted to the TSC team under special licensing conditions
that will not allow the asset to be used outside of the game.
